A package which allows for easy recursive cloning and persistence of Laravel Eloquent models, including:
- Recursive cloning of Eloquent models and their relationships without forced persistence, allowing for in-memory changes to cloned models before they are saved to the database
- Persistence of recursive relationships including cloned pivot data

_Since this is a feature I commonly rely on in client projects, I decided to extract the functionality into a package.  
However this also has the consequence that your mileage may vary, and hence pull requests are welcome - please see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details._


## Structure

```

tests/
vendor/
```


## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require anfischer/cloner
```

## Usage

``` php
use Anfischer/Cloner;

$clone = (new CloneService)->clone($someEloquentModel);
$persistedModel = (new PersistenceService)->persist($clone);

or

$cloner = new Cloner(new CloneService, new PersistenceService);
$clone = $cloner->clone($someEloquentModel);
$persistedModel = $cloner->persist($clone);

or

$clone = \Cloner::clone($someEloquentModel);
$persistedModel = \Cloner::persist($clone);

---

Cloner also exposes a convinience method for cloning and persisting at the same time:

$cloner = new Cloner(new CloneService, new PersistenceService);
$persistedModel = $cloner->cloneAndPersist($someEloquentModel);
