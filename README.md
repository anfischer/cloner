A package which allows for easy recursive cloning and persistence of Laravel Eloquent models, including:
- Recursive cloning of Eloquent models and their relationships without forced persistence, allowing for in-memory changes to cloned models before they are saved to the database
- Persistence of recursive relationships including cloned pivot data

_Since this is a feature I commonly rely on in client projects, I decided to extract the functionality into a package.
However this also has the consequence that your mileage may vary, and hence pull requests are welcome - please see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details._
